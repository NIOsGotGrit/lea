# System Analysis: AI Chat Assistant Integration

Okay, I understand. You want to translate the conceptual plan in `analysis.md` into a concrete implementation strategy tailored to the `ferdium-app` codebase structure. Let's figure out where the new components should live and why.

To do this effectively, I first need to get a better sense of the current project structure. I'll list the contents of the `src` directory.

Ran tool
Okay, let's break down how we can integrate the AI chat assistant into your existing `ferdium-app` structure, following the patterns I see in the codebase.

Here's a proposed plan, mapping the conceptual components from `analysis.md` to specific directories and files:

**1. Feature Encapsulation (`src/features/ai-chat`)**

*   **Why:** The codebase already uses a `features` directory (e.g., `src/features/appearance`). This is a good pattern for grouping related functionality. We'll create a new feature directory for our chat assistant.
*   **Action:** Create a new directory: `src/features/ai-chat`

**2. Renderer Process (UI - Resides within the feature)**

*   **UI Components (`src/features/ai-chat/components`)**
    *   **Why:** Keep UI elements related to this feature self-contained.
    *   **Action:** Create `src/features/ai-chat/components/`. Inside, we'll add minimal React components like `ChatWindow.tsx`, `MessageInput.tsx`, and `MessageList.tsx`.
*   **Container/View (`src/features/ai-chat/containers` or directly in `components`)**
    *   **Why:** We need a top-level component to assemble the UI parts and manage local state/interactions for the chat.
    *   **Action:** Create `src/features/ai-chat/containers/ChatView.tsx` (or similar) which will use the components above.
*   **Routing (`src/routes.tsx`)**
    *   **Why:** To make the chat UI accessible, we need to integrate it into the application's navigation.
    *   **Action:** Modify `src/routes.tsx` to add a new route (e.g., `/ai-chat`) that renders the `ChatView` container.
*   **IPC Communication (Preload Script)**
    *   **Why:** Securely expose communication channels between the renderer and main processes.
    *   **Action:**
        *   We'll likely need to define the specific channels in a shared place or directly use strings for now.
        *   Modify an existing preload script or create a new one (e.g., `src/electron/preload/ai-chat.ts` if grouping preload scripts makes sense, or potentially augment the main one if simple enough). This script will use `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld` to provide functions like `window.aiChat.sendMessage(msg)` and `window.aiChat.onTokenReceived(callback)`.
        *   Ensure this preload script is loaded for the `BrowserWindow` that will display the chat UI (configured likely in `src/index.ts` or wherever the main window is created).

**3. Main Process (Coordinator - Resides in `src/electron`)**

*   **IPC Handling (`src/electron/ipc/ai-chat.ts` or similar)**
    *   **Why:** Keep main process logic organized. Handle incoming messages from the renderer here.
    *   **Action:** Create `src/electron/ipc/ai-chat.ts`. Inside, use `ipcMain.on('ai-chat:send-message', ...)` to listen for messages from the renderer. This handler will be responsible for forwarding the message to the agent subprocess. Import and initialize these handlers in your main Electron entry point (`src/index.ts` or `src/electron/main.ts`).
*   **Agent Subprocess Management (`src/electron/agent/manager.ts` or similar)**
    *   **Why:** Centralize the logic for spawning, communicating with, and managing the lifecycle of the agent subprocess.
    *   **Action:** Create `src/electron/agent/manager.ts`. This module will contain functions to:
        *   `spawn` the agent process (using `child_process`).
        *   Get a reference to the agent's `stdin` and `stdout`.
        *   Write messages to `stdin`.
        *   Listen to `stdout` for token streams.
        *   Handle agent errors and exit events.
*   **Streaming Back to Renderer:**
    *   **Why:** Send the agent's response back to the UI.
    *   **Action:** When the `agent/manager.ts` receives data on the agent's `stdout`, it will use the `webContents` object (available in the `ipcMain` handler context) to send the token back to the renderer using `webContents.send('ai-chat:stream-token', token)`.

**4. Agent Subprocess (AI Logic - Resides outside main Electron source, but maybe in the project root)**

*   **Location (`agent/` or `src/agent/`)**
    *   **Why:** This is a separate Node.js process, not directly part of the Electron app bundle, although its source code can live within the project repository. Placing it at the root (`agent/`) emphasizes its separation, while `src/agent/` keeps all source code together. Let's start with `src/agent/` for simplicity during development, but be mindful that it needs a separate build step.
    *   **Action:** Create `src/agent/`.
*   **Entry Point (`src/agent/index.ts`)**
    *   **Why:** The starting point for the agent subprocess.
    *   **Action:** Create `src/agent/index.ts`. This script will:
        *   Read from `process.stdin`.
        *   (Initially) Mock processing and generating tokens.
        *   Write tokens to `process.stdout`, ensuring each token/message is clearly delimited (e.g., newline-separated).
*   **Build Configuration**
    *   **Why:** The agent code needs to be compiled (TypeScript to JavaScript) independently of the main Electron app build.
    *   **Action:** Modify your build process (e.g., `package.json` scripts, `webpack.config.js`, or `tsconfig.json`) to include a separate step that compiles `src/agent/index.ts` into a runnable JavaScript file (e.g., `dist/agent/index.js`). The `agent/manager.ts` in the main process will then spawn *this compiled file*.

**Summary of New/Modified Files/Dirs:**

*   `src/features/ai-chat/` (new dir)
    *   `components/` (new dir)
        *   `ChatWindow.tsx` (new file)
        *   `MessageInput.tsx` (new file)
        *   `MessageList.tsx` (new file)
    *   `containers/` (new dir)
        *   `ChatView.tsx` (new file)
*   `src/routes.tsx` (modified)
*   `src/electron/preload/ai-chat.ts` (new or modified existing preload)
*   `src/electron/ipc/ai-chat.ts` (new file)
*   `src/electron/agent/manager.ts` (new file)
*   `src/index.ts` or `src/electron/main.ts` (modified to init IPC and agent manager)
*   `src/agent/` (new dir)
    *   `index.ts` (new file)
*   Build configuration (`package.json`, `webpack.config.js`, etc.) (modified)

This structure keeps the new feature well-organized and follows conventions already present in your project. How does this plan sound to you? We can start by creating these directories and placeholder files.

3. **Phase 3:** Agent can process messages and stream responses
4. **Phase 4:** Advanced features work reliably and enhance UX
5. **Phase 5:** All tests pass and documentation is complete

## 📝 Development Guidelines

1. **Testing:** Write tests alongside new features
2. **Documentation:** Update docs as features are implemented
3. **Reviews:** Each phase should be code reviewed
4. **Feedback:** Gather user feedback early and often

This phasing plan allows for incremental development and testing, with each phase building on the previous one. Each task is atomic and can be completed independently, making it easier to track progress and distribute work if needed.
