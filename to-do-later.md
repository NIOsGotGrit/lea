To make it truly invisible/take no space in fullscreen, we could conditionally set the height of the titleArea to 0 or change the gridTemplateRows when isFullScreen is true. We can address this refinement in Phase 4 (Cleanup) or later, but the core logic to hide the content is already there.


Since the core grid layout for the drawer is working, I agree with your assessment â€“ let's treat the tooltip rendering as a separate, minor styling issue, likely within the Sidebar component or its ReactTooltip usage. We can add it to our list for Phase 4 (Cleanup).
